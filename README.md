# üêßüöÄ My First ROS2 + Linux Setup with Turtlesim

This is the first step in my journey learning Linux and ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) using a virtual machine. I installed everything from scratch and ran the classic Turtlesim demo üê¢ to start exploring robot control.

## üì¶ What I Used:

- üíª Ubuntu 22.04 inside VirtualBox

- ü§ñ ROS2 Humble

- üê¢ Turtlesim package (to simulate a moving turtle robot)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps:

1. Installed ROS2

Followed the official ROS2 install guide for Humble:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl gnupg2 lsb-release
```

‚Üí Added keys, setup repo, then:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

2. Sourced ROS2 (So it works in every terminal)

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Installed Turtlesim üê¢

```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlesim
```

4. Ran the Simulation

In Terminal 1:

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

In Terminal 2:

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```

And this will make me control the turtle using my keyboard arrows!

## üß™ Beginner Linux + ROS2 CLI Tools I Explored üß∞

| Command                          | What it does                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`                | Basic file navigation in Linux                   |
| `sudo apt install`               | Installing packages from terminal                |
| `source ~/.bashrc`               | Reloads terminal config                          |
| `printenv`                       | Checks environment variables (like `ROS_DISTRO`) |
| `ros2 run`                       | Runs a node from a ROS2 package                  |
| `ros2 pkg executables <package>` | Lists available executables                      |
| `ros2 topic list`                | Shows all active topics                          |
| `ros2 topic echo <topic>`        | Shows messages from a topic                      |
| `ros2 node list`                 | Lists all running ROS2 nodes                     |
| `ros2 interface show`            | Displays the message structure of a topic        |

These tools helped me understand how Linux and ROS2 communicate and gave me full control from the terminal.

## üß† What I Learned:

- How to install and source ROS2 correctly

- How to manage multiple terminals in ROS2

- How ROS2 uses topics and nodes to communicate.

- How to run and control simulation nodes

- How to debug .bashrc errors 


## ‚ú® Why This Matters:

This is the foundation for everything I'll build next ‚Äî robots, AMRs, Robotic Arms, AI-controlled systems ‚Äî it all begins here üöÄ.
